# About scicode-learn

The goal of **scicode-learn** is to be an aggregation website for scientific programming resources. The project is particularly geared towards intro-to-programming material and guides that are more field-specific (e.g., making psychology experiments, data analyses for genetics research, etc.). The website will aggregate resources—from cheatsheets to online courses—particularly in Python, R, and Matlab, but also in other languages.

If you're interested in contributing to the website, check us out on Github!
