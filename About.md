# About scicode-learn

The goal of scicode-learn is to be an aggregation website for scientific programming resources. The project is particularly geared towards intro-to-programming material and guides that are more field-specific (e.g., making psychology experiments, data analyses for genetics research, etc.). The website will aggregate resources—from cheatsheets to online courses—across Python, Matlab, and R.
